## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Download the following files:
   
--yolov3.weights
--yolov3.cfg
--coco.names

3. Run the app:

--python main.py

ðŸ“š About the Facts System
Each object detected by the model is matched to a .txt file in the facts/ folder.

Example: chair.txt â†’ contains a short description of a chair.

This creates a minimal expert system mapping visual input to contextual information.

ðŸ“Œ Notes
Youâ€™ll need to place a sample image like example_image.jpg in the root directory.

The program supports offline use.
